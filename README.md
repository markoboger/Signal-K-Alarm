## Build

To generate javascript from the scalajs project, the command `sbt fastOptJS` can be used.
The resulting file is found under `/target/scala-2.12/`.

## Tests

To run `sbt test` successfully, the jsdom package has to be installed prior to that.
This can be done via npm with `npm install jsdom`.
